This is a fork of qemu/qemu for Docker.  The organization is as follows:

* [branch] - mirror of original qemu/qemu branch - no additinal changes here
* [moby/branch] - based on [branch] but contains Docker specific and un-upstreamed changes.

The default branch is [moby/master].

In general, we follow the practices as documented in:
